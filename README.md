# Story
So, I was asked by a client to implement Sass on a Joomla project with the color variables comes from PHP variables. Then I found this library and tried to make a small example using it.

# Documentation
http://leafo.github.io/scssphp/docs/

# Disclaimer
This small project is a small example implementation only using scssphp by leafo. The library is not mine. I repeat, the library is not mine. Over and out! *(insert radio static noise)*
